# CSMATH_HOMEWORK
All algorithms are supposed to work well on N-dimensional datasets.
Datasets for homeworks are always generated by some gaussian distribution, except homework2 which use the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set.

svm is implemented using SMO algorithm.

here is the couese paper mission:
we first implement softmax, then multi-layer perceptron, then convolutional neural networks and finally recurrent neural networks.
The first Three are tested on MNIST dataset, and RNN are to be decided how to test it.

get more free time, will try RCNN.
