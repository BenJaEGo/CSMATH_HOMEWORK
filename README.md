# CSMATH_HOMEWORK
All algorithms are supposed to work well on N-dimensional datasets.

Datasets for homeworks are always generated by some gaussian distributions, except that, homework2 uses the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set, and extra homework use MNIST dataset.

In homework1, regression for curve fitting use both gradient-based algorithm and normal equation.

In homework2, PCA is mainly implemented by np.linalg.svd() (sorry for that..)

In homework3, kmeans is implemented in a vectorized style and gmm is implemented using EM algorithm.

Doesn't want to implement homework4 (LM algorithm), select conjugate prior instead.

In homework5, svm is implemented using SMO algorithm.


here is the course paper mission (extra homework):
First implement softmax, then multi-layer perceptron, finally convolutional neural networks, test them on MNIST dataset.


To be done: recurrent neural networks and RCNN.
